# ac-11.1 - \[\] Pattern-hiding Displays

## Control Statement

**Conceal, via the device lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly viewable image**.

The pattern-hiding display can include static or dynamic images, such as patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock, battery life indicator, or a blank screen with the caveat that controlled unclassified information is not displayed.

## Control assessment_objective

information previously visible on the display is concealed, via device lock, with a publicly viewable image.
