# ac-2.5 - \[\] Inactivity Logout

## Control Statement

Require that users log out when [time period of expected inactivity or description of when to log out].

## Control guidance

Inactivity logout is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to log out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the defined period. Automatic enforcement of inactivity logout is addressed by [AC-11](#ac-11).

## Control assessment_objective

users are required to log out when [time period of expected inactivity or description of when to log out].
