# au-12 - \[\] Audit Record Generation

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Provide audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of auditing as defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a) on [system components];

- \[b.\] Allow [personnel or roles] to select the event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system; and

- \[c.\] Generate audit records for the event types defined in [AU-2c](#au-2_smt.c) that include the audit record content defined in [AU-3](#au-3).

## Control guidance

Audit records can be generated from many different system components. The event types specified in [AU-2d](#au-2_smt.d) are the event types for which audit logs are to be generated and are a subset of all event types for which the system can generate audit records.

## Control assessment_objective

- \[AU-12a.\] audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of auditing (defined in AU-02_ODP[01]) is provided by [system components];

- \[AU-12b.\]  [personnel or roles] is/are allowed to select the event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system;

- \[AU-12c.\] audit records for the event types defined in AU-02_ODP[02] that include the audit record content defined in AU-03 are generated.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- For implementation status enter one of: implemented, partial, planned, alternative, not-applicable -->

<!-- Note that the list of rules under ### Rules: is read-only and changes will not be captured after assembly to JSON -->

### This System

<!-- Add implementation prose for the main This System component for control: au-12 -->

#### Implementation Status: planned

### Ubuntu_Linux_24.04_LTS

<!-- Add control implementation description here for control: au-12 -->

#### Rules:

  - sshd_set_loglevel_info
  - sshd_set_max_auth_tries
  - sudo_custom_logfile
